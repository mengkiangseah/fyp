\hl{This section assesses how well the objectives were achieved. This means looking at what was achieved, and comparing that to the requirements captured in the previous chapter. I will discuss why certain things were achieved, or why failures happened. I will also discuss how improvements could have been made with certain elements, or if the design choices were ultimately successful and why/why not. I expect this to take between 3-4 pages.}
