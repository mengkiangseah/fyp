\subsection{Cost}
The overall cost of this system cannot be exorbitant. The trouble with this estimation is that the raw cost of materials in this project is not the average cost, were such a system to be commercialised. There are economies of scale, partnerships, and the cost of development in the prototype as opposed to the cost of labour in a marketable version. This qualitative criterion means that the overall cost of project must one that can be lowered through mass-production. This is in contrast to fixed raw material costs, for example, which are not a concern here.

\hl{This section assesses how well the objectives were achieved. This means looking at what was achieved, and comparing that to the requirements captured in the previous chapter. I will discuss why certain things were achieved, or why failures happened. I will also discuss how improvements could have been made with certain elements, or if the design choices were ultimately successful and why/why not. I expect this to take between 3-4 pages.}
