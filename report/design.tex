\hl{This section will highlight the choices and progression of the design and features. While the actual method I used was a more agile-modular approach to the system, I will reorganise the material. This section will feature the choices, features, and justifications behind each element's final form.}

\hl{There is also a particular paper on IEEE Xplore that evaluated and suggested a number of filtration algorithms, some of which I am using here. However, the paper did not attempt any of them practically, and they were more suitable to pure VoIP phones, along with not considering any of the intended audience. Combining their findings, with my analysis from a practical perspective, and knowing the more restricted audience, I will look at how my filtration flow stacks up. Their methods of evaluating forms of filtration will also be reconsidered, and I am planning on critically commenting it. All this means this chapter will be at least 5-6 pages, but may extend up to 10.}


\hl{The solution is therefore to use a Raspberry Pi. The Pi will run the Asterisk PBX, which will perform the various filtration steps {\cite{raspbx}}.}
