\todo[inline, color=green!40]{The ending portion will summarise the results from the testing and briefly restate the outcome of the evaluation section. I expect this to not exceed a page. As for the future work, depending on what I manage to complete, and what is left, this section will also not exceed a page. I am not sure how much of the results will be worth restating, or if any visual aids will be included (an overall setup picture, or something similar).}
